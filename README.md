# CISS242 & CISS243
Programming II and Programming III courses from Columbia College

These courses taught introductory programming courses in C++. 
Topics included strings, pointers, recursion, classes, methods,
operator overloading. inheritance, polymorphism, templates, 
stream I/O, file processing, stacks, queues and lists.

I skipped CISS241 since these topics were mostly a review for me.
I took these courses as electives and as prerequisites for the more
exciting courses at Columbia College (CISS350 Advanced Algorithms &
CISS360 Assembly Language). I studied at Columbia College in addition 
to BYU Idaho since Columbia College offered these advanced courses in 
CS that I craved. They were not required. I filled most of my electives 
with additional CS courses since that's what I love.
